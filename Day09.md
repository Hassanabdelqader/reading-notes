# Functional Programming Concepts
## 1- What is functional programming?

Ans :it is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

## 2- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

the function that contains fixed data inside it, and it will not affect any other global variables as an example.
we know the function is pure by : 1- it will return the same result for same argument every time. 2- it will not make any observable side effects.

## 3- What are the benefits of a pure function?

Ans : we can test the pure functions easier than impure functions.

## 4- What is immutability?

Ans : it is the fixed data that will not be able to change over the time.

## 5- What is Referential transparency?

Ans : when we have a pure function with immutable data then we will have the referential transparency.

# 11- What is a module?

Ans : that is a component or thing(function, variable,..) that you would to use it outside his original file.

Ans : it will import the exported module into the new file.

## 33 -  How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

Ans : we have to import it and use it by require method.

## 4- What do we have to do to make a module available?

Ans : export it firstly from its original file, then import it to the new file by require.
