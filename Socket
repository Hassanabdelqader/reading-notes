# Socket.io

> Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It consists of: a Node. js server: Source | API. a Javascript client library for the browser (which can be also run from Node) .


# Review, Research, and Discussion

**What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?**

- to transform larged data for many computers by dividng them into small pieces.




# Preparation Materials

# OSI Model Explained

- open system interconnection model : that we use to connect or interact two computers togethor.

- it consists of seven layers :

  1.application layer : contains used protocols in networking, our app in the PC use these protocols, like HTTP.

  2.presentation layer : recives the data from application layer, then translate them, compress them, and encrypt them.

  3.session layer : prepare the connection between two computers, session managment, authentication, authorization process. and keep tracking the files.

  4.transport layer : controls the size, speed, correct data transmission.

  5.network layer : determines the IP of two machines, sender and reciever and check if data will reach the correct device or not.

  6.data link layer : access the media.

  7.physical layer : convert the data to signals, and will go through the previous layers till the application layer, then the reciever can see the transported data correctly.

# TCP Handshakes Explained

- TCP : transmission control protocol.
- many applications use TCP like; web, and email.
- before request to access any website TCP will make a connection between the client and the server.

- the connection will be done by three-way handshake :

  - first thing client send a request to the server, SYNC asking to connect.
  - then server will reply with SYNC ACK, that's mean approved and ask client to connect also.
  - last step client reply with ACK, I accept the connection.

- then both of them have a two way connection.

# Web Sockets

- WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

- Most browsers support the protocol, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera.

# Socket.io vs Web Sockets

- WebSocket is the communication Protocol that provides bidirectional communication between the Client and the Server over a TCP connection.
- Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers.
- Socket.io uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface.
- Socket.io has two sides :

  - client side : library that run inside the browser.
  - server side : library run with node.js

- IO works on work-based events. there are some reserved events that can be accessed using the Socket on the server side like Connect, message, Disconnect, Ping and Reconnect.

- There are some Client based reserved events like Connect, connect- error, connect-timeout and Reconnect etc.

**WebSocket :**

- connect with TCP connection.
- full duplex communication on TCP connections.
- doesn't support proxy and load balancer.
- doesn't support the broadcasting.
- doesn't have fallback option.

**Socket.io :**


- WebSocket is the technology, while Socket.io is a library for WebSockets.
